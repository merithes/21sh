tabs + backdel won't work correctly
	|_>	This is due to the method I use, as I go back
		one'slot' per one 'slot', and tabs are 4 slots
		(or maybe more depending on the term.
		I need to check that)

typing keys more than there is space to on a single line will
work, it will go to the next line, but it's not possible to
go back to the previous line, may it be with arrows or backdel
	|_>	I use a 'go back one by one' technique, which
		ignores newlines.
