tabs + backdel won't work correctly

Resolved: Issue only occuring on Linux (Fedora, Terminator).
typing keys more than there is space to on a single line will
work, it will go to the next line, but it's not possible to
go back to the previous line, may it be with arrows or backdel

Resolved: Added a check before registering the history.
entering a blank line will add it to the cmd history.Not supposed to happen
	|_>	I simply append a copy of the current cmdl to the history chained list.
		I should check if the actual cmdl is empty (or contains only spaces)

Resolved: won't free if here is no previous history element.
segfault on crl+d

when going back using left arrow, pressing space will re-print characters of
the precedent string. Not supposed to happen(don't you say) but works in every
case (not hard to reproduce)
